# Overview

This is a rust implementation of a lexer for a simple programming language. The lexer reads source code and converts it into a series of tokens that can be used for further processing, such as parsing or interpretation.

A lexer is a fundamental component of a compiler or interpreter, responsible for breaking down the input source code into manageable pieces.

These pieces, called tokens, represent the smallest units of meaning in the source code, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals.

A lexer processes the input text character by character, grouping them into tokens based on predefined rules.

I want to do this since I want to learn rust and how programming languages work.

# Development Environment

I'll simply be using Rust and Cargo for this project.

This project uses Rust.
